I'm Surya, 21 year old. I completed my B.Tech (2011-2015) in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at NIT Warangal. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision and image processing. During my B.Tech, I worked research projects on computer vision at RWTH Aachen (Germany), IISc Banglore (India) and Defense Research Development Organisation (India).

Presently, I'm taking an year away from formal education to work on myself- spending time on the ground floor refining my skills. Apart from working on projects in my research interests, I am exploring various fields that I am not acquanited to. I believe they will ultimately help me to do better research in my field by understanding the needs and concerns of societies. In this journey, Iâ€™ve completed more than 35 online courses on the MOOC platforms such as edX and Coursera.
